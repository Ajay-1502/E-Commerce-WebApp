            <strong>The Generics</strong> is more than just a rock band â€” we're
            a rebellion set to music. Formed in the underground scene of
            Bangalore, our sound blends raw guitar riffs, soul-punching vocals,
            and stories that hit home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, weâ€™ve rocked hundreds of stages, built a community
            of die-hard fans, and released albums that speak to the hearts of
            misfits and dreamers alike. Now, weâ€™re bringing that same energy
            online â€” not just to share our music, but to connect directly with
            you.
          </p>

            This webapp is your backstage pass: grab our latest albums, stream
            exclusive tracks, and check out our official band merchandise.
            Whether youâ€™ve been moshing with us since day one or just joined the
            tribe â€” welcome to the chaos.
